# BadApple

I was trying to play the Bad Apple music video on a DMG gameboy

I was able to play the first 5-ish seconds at 12fps, but due to the lack of memory and short V-Blank time, i couldn't do the whole video
There was also a flickering effect that was caused due to repeatedly turning off and on the LCD

I've abandoned this project for the time being
